# Simple Chat Application

This is a simple chat application implemented in Python. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and exchange messages in real-time.

## Features

- Basic chat functionality: Users can send and receive messages in a chat room environment.
- Client-server architecture: Communication is facilitated through a central server that manages connections and message broadcasting.
- Command-line interface (CLI): Both the server and client components can be interacted with via the command line.

## Purpose

This project serves as a learning exercise for implementing socket programming and multithreading concepts in Python. It provides a foundation for understanding network communication and building basic chat applications.
